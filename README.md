## Things I learned from this
The reset method on forms
the onload attribute on body tag
getting more practice with localStorage

## Things I can do to improve this
make it semantic, instead of all of the divs
replace the vars with let/const
remove the functions from html and add them to main.js
fix up the styling
create an undo button to reopen the closed
use array methods in main.js
